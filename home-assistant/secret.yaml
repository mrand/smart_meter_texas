# SECURITY NOTE: --netrc-file line could be replaced with --user username:password, HOWEVER this exposes
#                 both on the command line, which might be seen by other users.
#                 Therefore recommend putting Your SMT password in the smart_meter.netrc file.
#                 Just like secrets.yaml, it should be marked to be ignored by github
#
# stuff above Terms and conditions line may not be required, but keeping on the assumption it could help guarantee
# JSON responses forever more.
#
# other options to consider adding if stops working: --tlsv1.2

# For reasons I don't yet understand, when using a template (like below in the last entry), 
#    HA will strip off the single quote (notice it's fine in the above call).
#    Escaping the single quote works, but in so doing, now HA strips all the double quotes... so
#    they have to be escaped also.  Never would have figured that out without turning on debug logs
